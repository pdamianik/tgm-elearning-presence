# tgm-elearning-presence

A presence for the https://github.com/lolamtisch/Discord-RPC-Extension firefox/chrome extension to support the website https://elearning.tgm.ac.at (for tgm staff and students only). This extension currently is only available in the form of a firefox addon. Distribution of this addon is done by me (the developer) so don't try to find it on https://addons.mozilla.org/. However, you can find the extension file in the [releases](https://github.com/pdamianik/tgm-elearning-presence/releases/latest).
